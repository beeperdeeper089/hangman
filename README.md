# hangman
Hangman in C++

Does what it says on the tin :)

Uses CMake for the build system. To build, install CMake, and run:
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
```

And then run:
```
cmake --build build
```

Or, once running ``cmake -H. -Bbuild``, if you have Visual Studio installed, there will be a .sln (solution) file in build/. Open that and you have the hangman project in a familiar IDE where you can build from too.
